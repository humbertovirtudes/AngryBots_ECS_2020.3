# AngryBots ECS (Updated for Unity 2020.3)

The DOTS project used for the presentation Converting Your Game to DOTS and contains an example of how DOTS could be used to replace a low performance process in your games (shooting many bullets at once, in this case). This is meant to provide a simple, targeted example. A video presentation of this project can be seen [here](https://github.com/UnityTechnologies/AngryBots_ECS#:~:text=can%20be%20seen-,here,-The%20basics)

I merely took the existing project and updates the DOTS implementation to be compatible with Unity 2020.3

If enemies and bullets aren't rendering, add scripting define symbol: *ENABLE_HYBRID_RENDERER_V2* to your project.

NOTE: These shaders wont work on Unity 2021 as of published date.
